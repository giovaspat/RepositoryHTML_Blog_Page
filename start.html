        <h2>The utility of HTML</h2>

          <section id="Html utility">

           

        <p> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the fundamental language used to create web pages. In fact, the
        structure of a web page is based on it, since it provides a set of tags and attributes that allow you to organize web
        content in a structured way, such as texts, images, forms and more. Furthermore, we may also set a page at a semantic
        level, to allow for better understanding and interpretation by web browsers, search engines, web scrapers, web crawlers
        and screen readers. Therefore, HTML is an important tool for creating web pages and ensuring a better user experience.</p>

        <p>Many other web technologies are based on HTML: in particular, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and formatting,
        and JavaScript work with HTML to create engaging web experiences. Ultimately, HTML is the foundation upon which the
        modern web is built, ensuring smooth and accessible web browsing for users around the world.</p>

        <p> Additionally, HTML is universally recognized as the most used markup language in the world. This is due to its ease of 
        use and its interoperability with web browsers, which have made HTML the standard for creating web pages. It is supported 
        by a large community of developers and organizations, and underpins virtually every web page we see and use every day.
        In the end, HTML is a constantly evolving language, with newer versions implementing more and more new features, which
        is why it will continue to be the dominant markup language for the future of the web.</p>
